\arguments{
\item{mspline}{A list of control parameters defining the spline model.

\code{knots}: Spline knots.  If this is not supplied, then the number
of knots is taken from \code{df}, and their location is taken from
equally-spaced quantiles of the observed event times in the
individual-level data.

\code{add_knots}: This is intended
to be used when there are \code{external} data included in the
model.  External data are typically outside the time period
covered by the individual data.  \code{add_knots} would then be chosen
to span the time period covered by the external data, so that the
hazard trajectory can vary over that time.

If there are external data, and both \code{knots} and \code{add_knots} are
omitted, then a default set of knots is chosen to span both the
individual and external data, by taking the quantiles of a vector
defined by concatenating the individual-level event times with
the \code{start} and \code{stop} times in the external data.

\code{df}: Degrees of freedom, i.e. the number of parameters (or basis
terms) intended to result from choosing knots based on quantiles
of the data.  The total number of parameters will then be \code{df}
plus the number of additional knots specified in
\code{add_knots}. \code{df} defaults to 10.  This does not necessarily
overfit, because the function is smoothed through the prior.

\code{degree}: Polynomial degree used for the basis function. The
default is 3, giving a cubic. This can only be changed from 3
if \code{bsmooth} is \code{FALSE}.

\code{bsmooth}: If \code{TRUE} (on by default) the spline is smoother
at the highest knot, by defining the derivative and second derivative
at this point to be zero.}

\item{prior_hscale}{Prior for the baseline log hazard scale
parameter (\code{alpha} or \code{log(eta)}).  This should be a call to a
prior constructor function, such as \code{p_normal(0,1)} or
\code{p_t(0,2,2)}.  Supported prior distribution families are normal
(parameters mean and SD) and t distributions (parameters
location, scale and degrees of freedom).  The default is a normal
distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 20.

Note that \code{eta} is not in itself a hazard, but it is proportional
to the hazard (see the vignette for the full model specification).

"Baseline" is defined by the continuous covariates taking a value
of zero and factor covariates taking their reference level.  To
use a different baseline, the data should be transformed
appropriately beforehand, so that a value of zero has a different
meaning.  For continuous covariates, it helps for both
computation and interpretation to define the value of zero to
denote a typical value in the data, e.g. the mean.}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations to draw}

\item{quantiles}{Quantiles used to summarise the implied prior distributions
of the simulated quantities.}

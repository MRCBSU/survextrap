\title{Determine M-spline basis weights which give a constant function.}
\usage{
mspline_constant_weights(mspline, logit = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mspline}{A list with components \code{iknots} (vector of internal knots), \code{bknots} (vector of boundary knots)
and \code{degree} (polynomial degree) defining an M-spline configuration.}

\item{logit}{If \code{TRUE} then the multinomial logit transform of the coefficients
is returned.  This is a vector of length one less than the number of coefficients,
with the rth element defined by \eqn{log(coefs[r+1] / coefs[1])}.}
}
\description{
This works by transforming the weights of the corresponding B-spline basis,
which are equal if the B-spline is a constant function.

# survextrap version 0.8 

The GitHub commit ?? implemented several changes that are listed here.  `survextrap` is now in "beta" status.  All major features are now implemented, but there may still be some lack of polish.

## New features 

* A new vignette `cetuximab`, giving an in-depth case study of a realistic use of `survextrap`.  To be included in a forthcoming paper.

* Improvements to usability and stability of M-splines:

    - `iknots` and `bknots` are replaced by a single `knots`, and the lower boundary knot is always fixed at zero.
	
	- `add_knots` can be used to add user-defined knots to the default ones.  See the case study.

    - New function `mspline_spec` to define M-spline knots based on data, in advance of fitting any models. 

    - M-splines are now smoother at the final knot through an option `bsmooth` which is on by default.  Thanks to Iain Timmins for the suggestion.

* Incremental restricted mean survival time (`irmst`) added.

* Any summary of the posterior distribution can be produced by supplying a list of summary functions (e.g. `mean`, `quantiles`) to output functions (such as `rmst` and `survival`).

## Bug fixes and improvements

* Bug fixes for `hazard()` and `hsurvmspline()`, which were using the wrong tail end of psurvmspline().

* Waning models no longer ignore non-proportional hazards and cure.  Waning vignette merged into the methods vignette.

* More information given when printing fitted model objects.

* More consistent naming of arguments and variables (e.g. `hscale` for hazard scale, and `hsd` for hazard smoothing parameter).

* Thorough documentation polishing and code tidying.

## TODO

## Stan code calculates the loglik for each observation in the generated quantities block
## Is this slow enough to think about doing it in R instead like rstanarm does? 
## We have now stored the loglik contributions in the object.
## Could calculate loo in the survextrap function, then delete the logliks.
## Stops people from doing their own indiv level diagnostics 
## Or just force people to use a data argument like in rstanarm 

#  ll <- loo::extract_log_lik(x$fit, sprintf("ll_%s",outcome), merge_chains=FALSE)
#  r_eff <- loo::relative_eff(exp(ll))
#  res <- loo::loo(ll, r_eff = r_eff)

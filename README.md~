# survextrap 


`survextrap` is an R package to estimate survival from a combination of 

1. A standard individual-level, right-censored survival dataset

2. "External" data sources in the following aggregate "count" form:

```{css,echo=FALSE}
th, td {
  padding: 5px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
}
```

<table> 
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Follow-up period </th>
<th colspan="2">Number</th>
</tr> 
<tr><th>Start time $t$</th><th>End time $u$</th><th>Alive at $t$</th><th>Still alive at $u$</th></tr>

<tr>
<td> $t_{1}$ </td>
<td> $u_{1}$ </td>
<td> $t_{2}$ </td>
<td> $u_{2}$ </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> $n_{1}$ </td>
<td> $r_{1}$ </td>
<td> $n_{2}$ </td>
<td> $r_{2}$ </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>etc...</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>

</tr>

</table>

Any number of rows can be supplied for the "external" data, and the time intervals do not have to be distinct or exhaustive. 

The package has been developed under the expectation that many forms of external data that might be useful for survival extrapolation (such as population data, registry data or elicited judgements) can be manipulated into this common "count" form.


### Principles  

* Extrapolations from short-term individual level data should be done using _explicit data or judgements_ about how risk will change over time. 

* Extrapolations should not rely on conventional parametric forms (e.g. Weibull, log-normal, gamma...) that do not have interpretations as meaningful _mechanisms_ for how risk changes over time.

* Instead of selecting (or averaging) traditional parametric models, an _arbitrarily flexible_ parametric model should be used, that _adapts_ to give the optimal fit to the short-term and long-term data in combination.


### How it works 

* Bayesian multiparameter evidence synthesis is used to jointly model all sources of data and judgements 

* An M-spline is used to represent how the hazard changes through time.  The Bayesian fitting method automatically chooses the optimal level of smoothness and flexibility.  Spline "knots" should span the period covered by the data, and any period where there is a chance that hazard may vary.

* A proportional hazards model is used to describe the relation of survival to predictors. 

* Mixture cure models are supported.  

* The Stan software is used to do MCMC (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) sampling from the posterior distribution.

* Estimates and credible intervals for survival, hazard, mean and restricted mean survival can easily be extracted from the fitted model.

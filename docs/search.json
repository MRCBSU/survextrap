Baseline defined mean continuous covariates reference level factor covariates. prior_logor_cure Priors log odds ratios cure probabilities. call p_normal() p_t().  default p_normal(0,2.5). prior_sdnp Prior standard deviation parameters smooth non-proportionality effects time non-proportional hazards models.  call p_gamma() list calls p_gamma() one component per covariate, prior_loghr. backhaz Name variable data giving background hazard relative survival models.  censored cases exact value matter. parameter estimates results models describe excess hazard survival top background. external data backhaz supplied, user also supply background survival start stop points columns external data named \"backsurv_start\" \"backsurv_stop\".  describe reference population backhaz, though package check consistency . basehaz_ops list control parameters defining spline model. iknots: Internal knots.  supplied, number knots taken df, location taken equally-spaced quantiles observed event times (concatenated distinct follow-times external data). bknots: Boundary knots.  supplied, boundary knots set zero maximum event time (including follow-times external data). df: Degrees freedom, .e. number parameters (basis terms) define hazard spline function time.
